# pixel run

> an extrenely hard javascript canvas mini game

Built with vanilla JS. When I was teaching the [Web Development course](https://www.ironhack.com/en/web-development) at Ironhack Barcelonam, all students had to build a game after only 2 weeks of curriculum. I had a lot of fun helping them and eventually playing their games. At some point I felt a bit jealous so I built one myself.

## WARNING: This code is not maintained

Very obvious - but due - WARNING: I will try to keep this clean and free from vulnerabilities, but use at your own risk ;-)

## How to play

- Just press space (or tap and hold) to slow down the pixel. 
- Tip: Slow down early to accelerate sooner
- If you slow down for too long you will kill the pixel

### How to win:

- There are only 5 levels and you have 3 minutes to complete all levels.
- You can die as many times as you want. 
- Finishing early and with less kills will give you bonus points.
